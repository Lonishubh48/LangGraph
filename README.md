# LangGraph
A hands-on guide to learning LangGraph through simple, visual, state-based workflows — starting from basics like a BMI calculator to building modular agents.
# 🌐 LangGraph Learning

Welcome to **LangGraph Learning** — a beginner-friendly notebook to help you understand how to build visual, stateful workflows in Python using [LangGraph](https://docs.langgraph.dev/).

> 🧠 No LLMs. Just simple logic + graphs + Python functions.

## 📓 What's Inside

This repo contains a single Jupyter Notebook with two hands-on LangGraph examples:

1. **BMI Calculator Workflow**
   - Takes user input for height and weight.
   - Calculates BMI and classifies the result.
   - Built with 3 nodes and clean state flow.

2. **Basic Calculator Workflow**
   - A simple arithmetic calculator for +, -, ×, ÷.
   - Demonstrates branching based on operation type.
   - Shows how to route logic dynamically using edges.

## 🚀 Why Use LangGraph?

LangGraph allows you to build **flowchart-like applications** using Python:

- 🔄 State flows through functional nodes (like `TypedDict`)
- 🔗 Edges determine execution flow based on outcomes
- 🔍 Easy to debug and visually follow logic

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LangGraph-Learning.git
   cd LangGraph-Learning
2. Install dependencies
   You’ll need Python 3.8+ and the following packages:
   ```bash
   pip install langgraph langchain ipykernel
3. Open the notebook

##💡 No LLMs? No Problem!
These examples focus on learning LangGraph fundamentals without requiring any large language models.
